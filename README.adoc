= Build Rust in Nix

Examples of building rust projects using Nix

== Tools
* `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`: ./buildrustpackage-example
* `crate2nix`: ./crate2nix-example

== Notes
I'm including the Tokio dependency as a git repo. It is absolutely unneeded but it forces to show how to deal with outputHashes for `buildRustPackage`.
