= Build Rust in Nix

Examples of building rust projects using Nix

== Tools
* `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`: ./buildrustpackage-example
* `crate2nix`: ./crate2nix-example

== Notes
* I'm including the Tokio dependency as a git repo. It is absolutely unneeded but it forces to show how to deal with outputHashes for `buildRustPackage`.

* I explicitly set lld as a linker since I'm not sure if it's the default for the stable channel. It is [.underline]#provided by `pkgs.llvmPackages.ld`#, which is a wrapper around `lld`. +
    `objdump -j .comment -s /path/to/target/debug/buildrustpackage-example` will show `Linker: LLD`
